## 🏆 **Why This Version Stands Out**  

Most "free" wallpaper engines are either **limited trials, packed with ads, or secretly mining data**. Our GitHub version is **truly free**, open-source, and **designed for users who value performance and privacy**. Plus:  

- **Regular updates** with new wallpapers & features.  
- **Works on Windows 10/11** (and even some Linux setups via compatibility layers).  
- **Supports multiple monitors** with independent wallpaper control.  
- **Built-in FPS limiter** to prevent unnecessary GPU strain.
